bom2basket

This python script combines several BOM files such as those generated by Altium Designer,
merges quantity and generates an excel file with 3 sheets: one for Digi-Key, one for Newark
and the last for the others.

As input, it takes an excel file with production data: each row contains the BOM file name,
the quantity of PCBs produced, A customer reference.

Requirements:
The BOM files are those generated by Altium, each one for a single PCB.

The columns needed are:
Dist:	Distributors (Digi-Key, Newark, others)
DPN:	Distributor part number
Quantity: this column is the quantity of components needed for 1 PCB only. 

The order of the columns are not important, there may be different distributors.
Be sure to spell the distributor names correctly: "Digi-Key" and "Newark" specially.
Others aren't checked.

The 3 lines in the script with 'pivot table' work, but the output file gives only the DPN and
merged quantities.
